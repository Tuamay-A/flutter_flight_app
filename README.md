# ✈️ Flight App (Expedia-Inspired Flutter Project)

A modern Flight Booking UI App built with Flutter, inspired by the Expedia mobile application.
This project is being developed collaboratively by a team of three members as part of our learning and practical experience in cross-platform mobile development.

## 📱 About The Project

The Flight App aims to replicate the core UI experience of a flight booking platform like Expedia.

The current focus of the project includes:

- Flight search interface

- Date selection UI

- Flight listing screens

- Clean and modern user interface

- Responsive design for multiple platforms

This project is mainly focused on frontend/UI development for now. API integration and backend connectivity may be added in future updates.
